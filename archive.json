      "body": "I think this will Mostly Just Work\u00ae\ufe0f -- we'll need the reference for how to construct an exporter in Early Data, but the mechanics otherwise stay the same. If the server rejects Early Data, the connection starts over as if that data was never sent, so it's easy enough to say that the client can start the counter from 1 and if Early Data is rejected, the counter resets to 1 with everything else about the application layer.\n\nThe main piece is negotiation, where we can borrow language from QUIC:\n\n>A client that attempts to send 0-RTT data MUST remember all other transport parameters used by the server that it is able to process. The server can remember these transport parameters or can store an integrity-protected copy of the values in the ticket and recover the information when accepting 0-RTT data. A server uses the transport parameters in determining whether to accept 0-RTT data.\n>\n>[...]\n>\n>A server MUST reject 0-RTT data if the restored values for transport parameters cannot be supported.\n\nSo similarly, we could say that \"A client that attempts to send requests using TLS 1.3 Early Data MUST remember whether this extension was negotiated on the previous connection and apply that state to the new connection. The server can remember the state or can store an integrity-protected copy of the state in the ticket and recover the information when accepting 0-RTT data. A server uses the negotiation state in determining whether to accept 0-RTT data. A server MUST reject Early Data if it would not reach the same negotiation result with regard to this feature.\"\n\n@kaduk, I understand you and @enygren had a conversation about this previously?",
